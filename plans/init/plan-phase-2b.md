Created: 2025-07-26 16:00:00 PST
Current Phase: 2B - Documentation & Developer Experience
Previous Phase: [Phase 2A - Core Implementation](plan-phase-2a.md)
Next Phase: [Phase 3 - Polish & Release](plan-phase-3.md)
Overview: [Plan Overview](plan-overview.md)

CRITICAL META-GOALS OF THIS PLAN
THIS PLAN MUST BE:
FULLY SELF-DESCRIBING: All context needed to resume work is IN THIS FILE.
CONSTANTLY UPDATED: Every action's results recorded IMMEDIATELY in the step.
THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: If it's not in the plan, it didn't happen.
SAFE TO RESUME: Any AI can pick up work by reading ONLY this file.
REMEMBER: External memory is unreliable. This plan is your ONLY memory.
CRITICAL: NEVER LEAVE THIS PLAN
YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THIS PLAN EXACTLY
TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS, YOU MUST FIRST UPDATE THIS PLAN FILE TO ADD STEPS THAT EXPLICITLY DEFINE THOSE CHANGES.

Anti-Drift Protocol - READ THIS EVERY TIME
THIS PLAN IS YOUR ONLY MEMORY. TREAT IT AS SACRED.
The Three Commandments:
RELOAD BEFORE EVERY ACTION: Your memory has been wiped. This plan is all you have.
UPDATE AFTER EVERY ACTION: If you don't write it down, it never happened.
TRUST ONLY THE PLAN: Not your memory, not your assumptions, ONLY what's written here.
Critical Rules:
ONE TASK AT A TIME – Never jump ahead.
NO ASSUMPTIONS – The plan is the only truth. If you need new info, update the plan with new steps to investigate, document, replan, act, and validate.
NO OFFROADING – If it's not in the plan, don't do it.
Step Execution Protocol – MANDATORY FOR EVERY ACTION
BEFORE EVERY SINGLE ACTION, NO EXCEPTIONS:
RELOAD PLAN: cat AI_PROGRESS/LouieAI_Bootstrap/plan-phase-2b.md | head -200
FIND YOUR TASK: Locate the current 🔄 IN_PROGRESS step.
EXECUTE: ONLY do what that step says.
UPDATE IMMEDIATELY: Edit this plan with results BEFORE doing anything else.
VERIFY: tail -50 AI_PROGRESS/LouieAI_Bootstrap/plan-phase-2b.md
THE ONLY SECTION YOU UPDATE IS "Steps" – EVERYTHING ELSE IS READ-ONLY NEVER:
Make decisions without reading the plan first.
Create branches without the plan telling you to.
Create PRs without the plan telling you to.
Switch contexts without updating the plan.
Do ANYTHING without the plan.
If Confused:
STOP.
Reload this plan.
Find the last ✅ completed step.
Continue from there.

Steps
Step 2.2.0: Expand documentation (usage & architecture)
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 17:00:00 PST
Action: Improve the documentation content now that functionality is fleshed out. Claude should:
README updates: If any new info or best practices emerged (not much new, but we can:
Emphasize that multiple types of outcomes can come from Louie (maybe mention if prompt triggers a graph, Louie might return a URL to Graphistry visualization, etc.).
If we have any known limitations or next steps, note them (maybe in an "About" or "Roadmap" section).
IMPORTANT: Mention the TODO comment about endpoint confirmation - documentation should note that the /api/ask endpoint is based on common REST patterns and subject to confirmation when official API docs become available.
Possibly add a badge or note about documentation link explicitly (we have link in usage).
Check if the placeholder <owner> can now be replaced if known (assuming by Phase 2B we know where the repo lives. If Graphistry, put "graphistry", if user personal, put that).
If not known, leave it.
Minor corrections if any issues (like ensure code fences closed properly, etc.).
Add any example output snippet if available? Hard without real calls.
IMPORTANT: Include error handling examples in documentation showing users how to catch and handle RuntimeError exceptions.
We'll primarily verify consistency and ensure error handling is well documented.
Docs index.md: Expand maybe the usage example with expected output or a more narrative:
Possibly add a section like "How it works" or "Next Steps" referencing architecture page or Graphistry docs.
We already have usage and example in README which mirrored in docs.
Could add one more example of handling a result:
e.g., if Louie returns a chart link, how to handle it (just speculation).
But without official info, maybe skip specifics.
Ensure index and architecture pages reflect the improved error handling:
IMPORTANT: Phase 2A implemented enhanced error handling with specific HTTPStatusError and RequestError handling. Documentation must reflect:
- LouieClient.ask() now provides detailed error messages with status codes
- JSON error extraction from API responses ("error" or "message" fields)  
- Separate handling for network errors vs HTTP errors
- All errors raise RuntimeError with descriptive messages for debugging
Architecture.md: Expand it with details:
Now we know exactly how we implemented, describe:
That LouieClient.ask issues an HTTP POST to {server}/api/ask sending the prompt and uses Graphistry's JWT for auth.
Outline what kind of responses might be returned: e.g., text answers, JSON with data, links to Graphistry viz (given Louie is about visualizing, likely it could respond with a graph ID or link).
Clarify what the client does not do: it doesn't store state, doesn't manage conversation context (Louie might handle context server-side, but our client is stateless).
Note thread safety: since we use no global state except Graphistry's global token, which is fine, the client is lightweight. Instances can be created as needed.
Indicate potential future improvements (which we actually plan in Phase 3 or beyond): async support, richer result handling, etc.
For example:
## Under the Hood

When you call `LouieClient.ask(prompt)`, the library:
1. Fetches your Graphistry authentication token (JWT) via `graphistry.api_token()`.
2. Makes an HTTP POST request to Louie.ai's REST API (default `https://den.louie.ai/api/ask`) with your prompt.
3. Includes the auth token in the request headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
4. On success, returns the response parsed from JSON. This could be a direct answer (text or data) or instructions/results (e.g., a link to a Graphistry visualization or a summarized dataset).
5. On failure, raises detailed `RuntimeError` exceptions:
   - For HTTP errors (4xx/5xx): Extracts JSON error messages from API response
   - For network errors: Provides network-specific error details  
   - For missing authentication: Clear message about calling graphistry.register()

The client itself does not maintain any session state. Each call is independent (Louie.ai may maintain context on the server side).

## Future Enhancements

- **Streaming Responses**: For large responses or conversational use, streaming output (and an async API) might be added.
- **Result Handling**: In the future, the client could parse known response formats (like recognizing if a response contains a Graphistry visualization link) and provide helper methods.
- **Additional API Endpoints**: As Louie.ai grows (dashboards, agent management, etc.), this library will add corresponding methods.
Changelog or version note: We haven't created a CHANGELOG.md, but we might start documenting changes:
Possibly create a minimal CHANGELOG.md summarizing v0.1.0 changes. But not requested.
Could hold off until a first release is imminent, which might be at end of Phase 3. So skip for now.
Security.md: Already has content, but since we have a security policy, maybe ensure the contact info is correct.
Possibly update supported versions to mention that at v0.1 we support all features, etc.
Fine as is.
Contributing.md: Check if any updates:
We said we plan pre-commit (phase 2B). If by now we didn't implement it yet, it's okay because it's said "to be set up in later phase".
We might mention running tests with multiple Python versions is done in CI but locally it's good to test with at least one.
Otherwise fine.
Stage and commit: After editing docs, commit changes e.g., "docs: update usage and architecture documentation".
Success Criteria:
Documentation is updated to reflect the state of the code and provide clearer guidance.
No broken links or formatting issues in docs.
The commit for doc changes is made.
Optionally, build docs locally to confirm (if significant changes).
The documentation now would be user-friendly for an initial release.
Result:
DOCUMENTATION UPDATES COMPLETED:
1. **README.md Enhancements**:
   - Added comprehensive Error Handling section with code examples
   - Added Current Limitations section documenting /api/ask endpoint assumption
   - Enhanced Features section to highlight robust error handling
   - All error types documented: HTTP, network, authentication

2. **docs/index.md Updates**:
   - Added Error Handling section with detailed error type explanations
   - Added Current Status section noting Alpha development stage
   - Documented API endpoint assumption and future confirmation needs

3. **docs/architecture.md Complete Rewrite**:
   - Added detailed "Under the Hood" flow explanation (5-step process)
   - Documented Design Principles: stateless, thread-safe, error transparency
   - Added Response Types section covering all expected response formats
   - Added Current Limitations and Future Enhancements sections
   - Comprehensive technical documentation for developers

4. **Quality Verification**:
   - MkDocs build successful: Documentation built in 0.15 seconds
   - No broken links or formatting issues detected
   - All enhanced error handling from Phase 2A properly documented

Enhanced documentation now provides clear guidance for users and comprehensive technical details for developers.

Step 2.3.0: Dev experience improvements (pre-commit hooks, Black formatting)
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 17:30:00 PST
Action: In Phase 2B we can introduce some dev tooling improvements, though major polish we left for Phase 3. But let's add pre-commit and code formatter now to not delay. Claude should:
Add Black to dev: We already included Black in dev dependencies in pyproject (at Phase 1 optional deps). We should integrate it:
Run black . locally to format the codebase. (Our code is small, but let's ensure consistent style, like double quotes etc. Since we possibly wrote with double quotes already, minimal changes expected.)
If Black reformats anything, ensure tests still pass (they should).
If changed, stage those changes (they would be trivial spacing or quotes).
Configure ruff to avoid conflicts with Black: In pyproject.toml, we might add:
[tool.ruff]
extend-ignore = ["E501"]  # Black handles line length
Because ruff might complain about line length which we let Black handle, and Black will break lines appropriately. Actually Black aims for 88 char by default. If we prefer, we could set Black line-length to 88 and ruff to ignore E501 or to 88 as well.
We can do this or rely on default. If our lines aren't too long (some might exceed 88 slightly?), better set it explicitly to avoid any CI issue.
Could add in pyproject:
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
or let default.
Probably fine without specifying, but adding doesn't hurt.
We'll also ensure ruff config if needed:
We can either do ruff.toml or in pyproject under [tool.ruff]. Let's do pyproject to keep things consolidated.
Example minimal:
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
ruff default is 88 too, so fine. If we had to ignore some rules, we add.
Actually, adding ruff config might require adding toml to dev if not included. But since we run via CLI, not needed.
Eh, skip heavy config, trust defaults. We'll just ensure all lint passes after Black.
Add pre-commit: Create .pre-commit-config.yaml:
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 25.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks
    rev: v1.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: python-check-blanket-noqa
Explanation:
This sets up Black, Ruff, Mypy hooks. Using ruff-pre-commit hook with --fix to auto-fix trivial issues.
Also includes a hook to flag misuse of # noqa (optional, could include other checks).
Now developers can run pre-commit install and then each commit triggers these checks/fixes.
We should mention this in CONTRIBUTING that one should enable pre-commit hooks.
Actually, we already alluded to it. We could update CONTRIBUTING to instruct to run pre-commit install.
Let's quickly add that:
In CONTRIBUTING.md under development setup, add:
- After installing, run `pre-commit install` to set up Git hooks for linting/formatting.
Stage that minor addition.
Test pre-commit config: Run pre-commit run --all-files to see if all hooks pass. Since we've manually run Black, ruff, mypy earlier, should be no issues. If any appear, fix them.
E.g., "python-check-blanket-noqa" might trigger if we had a # noqa without specifying rule. We likely didn't use any noqa, so fine.
Commit changes: Add .pre-commit-config.yaml and updated CONTRIBUTING.md. Commit as "chore: add pre-commit configuration for lint/format".
CI integration: Optionally, we can add a step in CI to run pre-commit on one environment (like Python 3.11) to ensure hooks pass. But since we already run ruff and mypy etc. separately, not necessary. Pre-commit would just repeat those tasks. We can skip to avoid redundancy.
If we wanted, we could have:
    - name: Run Pre-commit (Lint & Format)
      run: pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
But then we need to install pre-commit in CI too, which is an extra dep. And it essentially runs Black (which might reformat code and show diff if something not formatted, which is a fail). But if code is all formatted already, it's fine. It's a matter of preference.
As we have direct ruff/mypy in CI, it covers the same ground. We'll rely on devs to use pre-commit locally rather than run it in CI.
Update optional: Possibly bump requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel", "pre-commit"] in build-system, but pre-commit isn't needed to build or run, only dev. We already have it indirectly by including it in dev? Actually, we did not include pre-commit in dev extra. Should we? Usually yes, add "pre-commit" to dev dependencies so devs easily install it.
Do that: In pyproject optional dev, add "pre-commit==3.3.0" (latest version). Or just "pre-commit" unpinned, but pin for consistency.
Let's say pre-commit==3.3.0.
Then one can uv pip install .[dev] gets pre-commit too.
Stage pyproject change and commit perhaps combined with pre-commit config commit.
Check dev install: Now uv pip install -e ".[dev]" includes pre-commit. Ensure no conflicts, likely fine.
Success Criteria:
Code base is formatted per Black and ruff, no style issues left.
.pre-commit-config.yaml exists, and devs can use it.
CONTRIBUTING.md instructs to use it.
Pre-commit is in dev deps for easy installation.
All tests still pass after formatting changes.
The code changes from formatting are minimal and didn't break anything (our tests ensure that).
The commit for these changes is done.
Result:

Step 2.3.1: Create comprehensive developer documentation
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 18:00:00 PST
Action: Create detailed developer documentation for local development workflows. This is critical for maintainability and contributor onboarding. Claude should:

Create docs/development.md with comprehensive local dev guide:
- **File size limit**: Keep under 500 lines for AI readability (add rule at top)
- **Quick Start**: Fast setup for experienced developers (30 seconds to running tests)
- **Tool Usage**: Detailed uv, ruff, mypy, pytest workflows with examples
- **CI Integration**: How local tools match CI, debugging CI failures
- **Development Conventions**: Code style, commit messages, branch naming
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit testing, mocking patterns, test organization
- **Common Issues**: Troubleshooting guide for frequent developer problems
- **Release Process**: Step-by-step release workflow for maintainers

- Maintain clear separation: CONTRIBUTING = process, development.md = technical

Add development.md to MkDocs navigation:
- Update mkdocs.yml to include development guide
- Ensure it's easily discoverable in documentation site

Success Criteria:
- Developer can go from git clone to running tests in <2 minutes following the guide
- All local development tools clearly documented with examples
- CI troubleshooting section helps developers debug failed builds
- File stays under 500 lines but covers all essential developer workflows

   - Complete release workflow for maintainers
   - Clear separation from CONTRIBUTING.md (technical vs process)

The developer guide provides comprehensive coverage of local development workflows while staying concise and AI-readable.

Step 2.3.2: Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with workflow clarity
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 18:15:00 PST 
Action: Improve CONTRIBUTING.md to be more process-focused and better integrated with developer docs. Claude should:

Reorganize CONTRIBUTING.md structure:
- Keep contribution process, ethics, and community guidelines
- Reference docs/development.md for technical details
- Add clear workflow examples (feature development, bug fixes)
- Include PR template guidance and review process

Add practical contribution workflows:
- Feature development flow (issue → branch → develop → test → PR)
- Bug fix workflow (reproduce → fix → test → PR) 
- Documentation contribution process
- Release contribution process for maintainers

Improve integration with tooling:
- Clear examples of pre-commit usage
- How to handle CI failures in PRs
- Code review expectations and process

Success Criteria:
- Clear separation between process (CONTRIBUTING.md) and technical setup (docs/development.md)
- New contributors understand the full workflow, not just setup
- Maintainers have clear guidance for releases and reviews

Result:
CONTRIBUTING.MD ENHANCED WITH WORKFLOW CLARITY:

1. **Restructured CONTRIBUTING.md** (143 lines):
   - Clear separation: process-focused vs technical details
   - Quick start section with links to Developer Guide
   - Comprehensive contribution workflows for features, bugs, docs
   - Detailed code review process for both contributors and maintainers
   - PR guidelines with templates and formatting standards

2. **Process Integration**:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md focuses on community process and workflows
   - Technical details delegated to docs/development.md
   - Seamless cross-referencing between both documents
   - Clear paths for different types of contributions

3. **Workflow Coverage**:
   - Feature development: issue → branch → develop → test → PR
   - Bug fixes: reproduce → fix → test → PR
   - Documentation: gaps → branch → update → test → PR
   - Release process: clear maintainer guidance with links

The documentation now provides comprehensive coverage for both community process and technical development while maintaining clear boundaries.

Step 2.4.0: Implement dynamic versioning from git tags
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 18:30:00 PST
Action: Replace hard-coded version with dynamic versioning based on git tags. This is modern best practice for Python GitHub repos. Claude should:

Investigate current versioning approach:
- Check current pyproject.toml version field (currently hard-coded "0.1.0")
- Research modern Python dynamic versioning options:
  - setuptools_scm (most popular, integrates with setuptools)
  - hatch-vcs (modern, used by hatch build backend)
  - versioneer (older but still used)
  - Custom __version__ generation from git describe

Choose appropriate solution:
- For pyproject.toml + setuptools: setuptools_scm is standard
- For modern Python (3.11+): setuptools_scm with pyproject.toml integration
- Should work with: git tags, GitHub Actions, PyPI publishing

Implement dynamic versioning:
- Add setuptools_scm to build dependencies
- Update pyproject.toml to use dynamic = ["version"]
- Configure setuptools_scm with appropriate settings
- Remove hard-coded version = "0.1.0"
- Test that version detection works locally

Verify version detection:
- Test with no tags (should show dev version like 0.1.0.dev1+g1234567)
- Test with git tag (should show clean version like 0.1.0)
- Test in fresh git clone (packaging scenario)
- Verify __version__ attribute is available in package

Success Criteria:
- Version is dynamically generated from git tags/commits
- No hard-coded version in pyproject.toml
- python -c "import louieai; print(louieai.__version__)" works
- python -m build . uses correct dynamic version
- Ready for proper semantic versioning workflow

Result:
DYNAMIC VERSIONING SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Setuptools SCM Configuration**:
   - Added setuptools-scm>=8 to build dependencies
   - Configured dynamic = ["version"] in pyproject.toml
   - Set version_file = "src/louieai/_version.py" for runtime access
   - Removed hard-coded version = "0.1.0"

2. **Package Integration**:
   - Updated __init__.py to import from _version.py with fallback
   - Generated _version.py file provides __version__ and __version_tuple__
   - Package version accessible via louieai.__version__

3. **Version Detection Verified**:
   - Clean tagged commits show exact version (e.g., "0.1.0")
   - Commits after tags show dev versions (e.g., "0.1.1.dev0+g130bd33.d20250726")
   - python -m build . creates packages with correct dynamic versions
   - Version detection works in both development and distribution contexts

4. **Tool Integration**:
   - Configured ruff to ignore generated _version.py file
   - Added lint ignores for generated file style issues
   - Excluded _version.py from ruff formatting
   - All quality checks pass (ruff, mypy, pytest)

5. **Release Workflow**:
   - Version now determined by git tags (semantic versioning)
   - Development versions include commit hash and date
   - Ready for proper release workflow: git tag v0.1.0 → clean version
   - No more manual version bumping required

Dynamic versioning eliminates manual version management and ensures consistency between git tags and package versions.

Step 2.4.1: Create CHANGELOG.md following modern best practices
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 19:00:00 PST
Action: Create CHANGELOG.md using keepachangelog.com format for maximum portability and compatibility. Claude should:

Create CHANGELOG.md:
- Follow keepachangelog.com format exactly
- Header with project name and format references
- Version 0.1.0 with proper date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Organize changes by type: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security
- Document Phase 1-2 work comprehensively:
  - Added: LouieClient class, error handling, documentation, dev tools
  - Changed: Python requirement to 3.11+, modernized dependencies
  - Fixed: Various implementation improvements

Include standard sections:
- [Unreleased] section for future changes
- Proper semantic versioning links

   - Portable format works on any git hosting platform
   - Follows semantic versioning standards

The CHANGELOG.md provides complete documentation for the initial release and establishes the standard for future releases.

Step 2.4.2: Add project metadata and URLs
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 19:15:00 PST
Action: Add PyPI project metadata and URLs for professional project presentation. Claude should:

Add project URLs to pyproject.toml:
- Documentation: https://louieai.readthedocs.io
- Source: https://github.com/<owner>/louieai
- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/<owner>/louieai/issues
- Changelog: https://github.com/<owner>/louieai/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- Repository: https://github.com/<owner>/louieai

Consider modern license format:
- setuptools shows deprecation warnings for license = { text = "Apache-2.0" }
- Modern format uses license = "Apache-2.0" (SPDX identifier)
- Update if needed to eliminate build warnings

Success Criteria:
- PyPI metadata complete with proper URLs
- Professional project presentation
- No deprecation warnings in build process

Result:
PYPI PROJECT METADATA AND URLS ADDED:

1. **Project URLs Added**:
   - Documentation: https://louieai.readthedocs.io

Step 2.4.3: Update developer guide for CHANGELOG + GitHub releases workflow
Status: ⏳ PENDING
Started: [timestamp]
Action: Update docs/development.md to document the modern dual-changelog approach. Claude should:

Add changelog section to Release Process:
- Explain CHANGELOG.md + GitHub releases dual approach
- Document keepachangelog.com format usage
- Add commands for updating CHANGELOG.md
- Explain how GitHub releases should reference changelog
- Include version comparison link generation

Update release workflow:
- Step 1: Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section
- Step 2: Test locally and commit changelog
- Step 3: Create git tag
- Step 4: Push tag (triggers CI)
- Step 5: Create GitHub release referencing CHANGELOG.md
- Step 6: Verify PyPI publication

Ensure under 500 lines:
- Keep concise while being comprehensive
- Focus on practical commands and examples
- Reference external resources where appropriate

Success Criteria:
- Developer guide documents modern changelog workflow
- Clear step-by-step release process
- Still under 500 line AI readability limit
- Matches actual project practices

Result:
[Fill this in with commands, output, decisions, errors, etc.]

Step 2.4.4: Test packaging and prepare for release
Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Started: 2025-07-26 19:45:00 PST
Action: Final packaging verification and release preparation. Claude should:

Create MANIFEST.in if needed:
- Ensure LICENSE, README.md, CHANGELOG.md included in sdist
- Test with python -m build . and inspect contents
- Verify wheel and sdist both contain necessary files

Build and test distributions:
- Run python -m build . to create wheel and sdist
- Check dist/ contents include all necessary files
- Verify dynamic version appears correctly in built artifacts
- Test installation from built wheel

CI and release workflow verification:
- Ensure all tests pass locally: ruff check . && mypy . && pytest
- Verify pre-commit hooks work correctly
- Document that PYPI_API_TOKEN needs to be added to GitHub secrets for release
- Note release process: git tag v0.1.0 → push → GitHub Actions publishes

Success Criteria:
- python -m build . creates clean distributions
- All files properly included in packages
- Dynamic versioning works in built artifacts
- Ready for PyPI release workflow

Result:
