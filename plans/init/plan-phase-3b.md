**THIS PLAN FILE**: `plans/init/plan-phase-3b.md`
**Created**: 2025-07-26 21:00:00 PST
**Current Branch if any**: main
**PRs if any**: None yet
**PR Target Branch if any**: N/A (working on main)
**Base branch if any**: main

See further info in section `## Context`

## CRITICAL META-GOALS OF THIS PLAN
**THIS PLAN MUST BE:**
1. **FULLY SELF-DESCRIBING**: All context needed to resume work is IN THIS FILE
2. **CONSTANTLY UPDATED**: Every action's results recorded IMMEDIATELY in the step
3. **THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: If it's not in the plan, it didn't happen
4. **SAFE TO RESUME**: Any AI can pick up work by reading ONLY this file

**REMEMBER**: External memory is unreliable. This plan is your ONLY memory.

## CRITICAL: NEVER LEAVE THIS PLAN
**YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THIS PLAN EXACTLY**
**TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS, YOU MUST FIRST UPDATE THIS PLAN FILE TO ADD STEPS THAT EXPLICITLY DEFINE THOSE CHANGES.**

### Anti-Drift Protocol - READ THIS EVERY TIME
**THIS PLAN IS YOUR ONLY MEMORY. TREAT IT AS SACRED.**

### The Three Commandments:
1. **RELOAD BEFORE EVERY ACTION**: Your memory has been wiped. This plan is all you have.
2. **UPDATE AFTER EVERY ACTION**: If you don't write it down, it never happened.
3. **TRUST ONLY THE PLAN**: Not your memory, not your assumptions, ONLY what's written here.

### Critical Rules:
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Never jump ahead
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - The plan is the only truth. If you need new info, update the plan with new steps to investigate, document, replan, act, and validate.
- **NO OFFROADING** - If it's not in the plan, don't do it

### Step Execution Protocol - MANDATORY FOR EVERY ACTION
**BEFORE EVERY SINGLE ACTION, NO EXCEPTIONS:**
1. **RELOAD PLAN**: `cat plans/init/plan-phase-3b.md | head -200`
2. **FIND YOUR TASK**: Locate the current üîÑ IN_PROGRESS step
3. **EXECUTE**: ONLY do what that step says
4. **UPDATE IMMEDIATELY**: Edit this plan with results BEFORE doing anything else
5. **VERIFY**: `tail -50 plans/init/plan-phase-3b.md`

**THE ONLY SECTION YOU UPDATE IS "Steps" - EVERYTHING ELSE IS READ-ONLY**

**NEVER:**
- Make decisions without reading the plan first
- Create branches without the plan telling you to
- Create PRs without the plan telling you to
- Switch contexts without updating the plan
- Do ANYTHING without the plan

### If Confused:
1. STOP
2. Reload this plan
3. Find the last ‚úÖ completed step
4. Continue from there

## Context (READ-ONLY - Fill in at Plan Creation)

### Plan Overview
**Raw Prompt**: "yes, update plan with granular steps here that make sense in order and address community needs." (in response to adding mkdocstrings API documentation)
**Goal**: Add professional API documentation using mkdocstrings to match modern Python projects like FastAPI/Pydantic
**Description**: Implement automatic API documentation generation from docstrings using mkdocstrings, creating a comprehensive API reference section
**Context**: The LouieAI project has complete user/developer documentation but lacks API reference docs. Modern projects use mkdocstrings for this.
**Success Criteria**: 
- mkdocstrings generates API docs from existing docstrings
- API reference section appears in documentation navigation
- Documentation quality matches FastAPI/Pydantic standards
- Zero warnings in strict build mode
**Key Constraints**: 
- Must integrate with existing MkDocs + Material theme setup
- Should not break existing documentation
- Must work with Google-style docstrings already in code

### Technical Context
**Initial State**:
- Working Directory: /home/lmeyerov/Work/louie-py
- Current Branch: `main` (ahead of origin/main by ~29 commits)
- Target Branch: `main` (continuing current work)

**Related Work**:
- Continues from: `plans/init/plan-phase-3.md` (Steps 3.3.0-3.3.3 reimplemented here)
- Previous phases completed: foundation, implementation, polish, CI simulation
- Depends on: Existing MkDocs setup with Material theme
- Blocks: None - this is final documentation enhancement

### Strategy
**Approach**: Add mkdocstrings in careful steps to ensure compatibility and quality
**Key Decisions**:
- Use mkdocstrings[python] for automatic API generation (matches FastAPI/Pydantic)
- Keep existing Google-style docstrings (already implemented)
- Structure API docs with overview + detailed class documentation
- Add cross-references and examples for community benefit

### Git Strategy
**Planned Git Operations**:
1. Work directly on main (continuing current session)
2. Commit after each major step completion
3. No PR needed (working on main branch)

**Merge Order**: Direct commits to main

## Code Change Philosophy (READ-ONLY)
**Minimalist approach**: Make surgical changes, not broad refactoring.
- **No syntactic changes** (unless requested) - formatting, renames, imports, etc.
- Research minimal solution first
- Test locally before pushing
- Revert quickly if wrong

## Quick Reference (READ-ONLY)
```bash
# Reload plan
cat plans/init/plan-phase-3b.md | head -200

# Local validation before pushing
./scripts/ci-local.sh
# Or individual tools:
./scripts/ruff.sh && ./scripts/mypy.sh
./scripts/pytest.sh -xvs

# Build and serve docs
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run mkdocs serve

# CI monitoring (use watch to avoid stopping - NEVER ASK USER)
gh pr checks [PR] --repo [owner/repo] --watch
gh run watch [RUN-ID]
watch -n 30 'gh pr checks [PR] --repo [owner/repo]'
```

## Step protocol

### RULES:
- Only update the current üîÑ IN_PROGRESS step
- Use nested numbering (1, 1.1, 1.1.1) to show hierarchy  
- Each step should be atomic and verifiable
- Include ALL context in the result (commands, output, errors, decisions)
- When adding new steps: Stop, add the step, save, then execute

### NEW STEPS
If you need to do something not in the plan:
1. STOP - Do not execute the action
2. ADD A STEP - Create it with clear description, action, success criteria
3. Mark it as üîÑ IN_PROGRESS
4. SAVE THE PLAN
5. THEN EXECUTE

### STEP COMPACTION

**Every ~30 completed steps, compact the plan:**
1. **CHECK STEP COUNT** - Count completed steps (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚è≠Ô∏è)
2. **CREATE HISTORY FILE** - Copy oldest 15+ completed steps to:
   - Path: `plans/init/history/phase3b-steps<start>-to-<end>.md`
   - Check existing history files first with `ls plans/init/history/`
   - Keep same format as plan.md
3. **REPLACE IN PLAN** - Replace archived steps with summary
4. **ADD COMPACTION TASK** - Before starting compaction, add it as a step
5. **VERIFY** - Ensure plan still makes sense after compaction

## Status Legend
- üìù **TODO**: Not started
- üîÑ **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently working on this
- ‚úÖ **DONE**: Completed successfully  
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Failed, needs retry
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **SKIPPED**: Not needed (explain in result)
