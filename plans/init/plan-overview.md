Plan Overview
=============

This multi-phase plan guides the bootstrapping of the LouieAI open-source Python library repository. The plan is divided into three phases, each building upon the previous to create a minimal but functional public Python OSS package.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Phase 1a - Initial Repository Setup](plan-phase-1a.md)** - Repository structure, packaging configuration, initial setup
- **[Phase 1b - Implementation & CI/CD](plan-phase-1b.md)** - Stub implementation, tests, documentation, CI/CD setup
- **[Phase 2a - Core Implementation](plan-phase-2a.md)** - Research API, implement enhanced LouieClient functionality
- **[Phase 2b - Documentation & Dev Tools](plan-phase-2b.md)** - Expand documentation, add developer tools, prepare for release
- **[Phase 3 - Polish & Release](plan-phase-3.md)** - Code quality improvements, coverage, final polish, and PyPI release

## Project Goals

Create a Python client library for Louie.ai that:
- Is installable via pip and uv
- Uses pyproject.toml with PEP 621-style configuration
- Depends only on pygraphistry, httpx, pandas, pyarrow for production
- Is safely typed (mypy), linted (ruff), and CI-checked via GitHub Actions
- Uses MkDocs for documentation on readthedocs.org
- Includes all standard OSS practices (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.)
- Follows GitFlow conventions with automated testing and publishing

## Phase Summary

### Phase 1a: Initial Repository Setup ✅
**Goal**: Create the foundational repository structure and packaging

**Key Deliverables**:
- Basic repository structure (src/louieai, tests, docs, workflows)
- pyproject.toml with PEP 621 metadata
- Apache 2.0 LICENSE
- .gitignore configuration
- Initial package setup and validation

**Success Criteria**: Repository structure is complete and package can be installed

### Phase 1b: Implementation & CI/CD ✅
**Goal**: Add stub implementation, tests, documentation, and CI/CD

**Key Deliverables**:
- Stub LouieClient implementation with basic tests
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Essential documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- MkDocs configuration
- AI planning template

**Success Criteria**: Package is installable, importable, and passes all CI checks

### Phase 2a: Core Implementation ⏳
**Goal**: Research API and implement enhanced LouieClient functionality

**Key Deliverables**:
- Research Louie.ai API patterns and endpoints
- Enhanced LouieClient.ask() implementation with robust error handling
- Expanded test suite with error scenario coverage
- HTTP and network error handling

**Success Criteria**: Client has robust error handling and comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 2b: Documentation & Dev Tools ⏳
**Goal**: Expand documentation and add developer experience improvements

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enhanced documentation with usage examples and architecture details
- Pre-commit hooks and Black formatting
- CHANGELOG.md and project URLs
- Release preparation and packaging verification

**Success Criteria**: Documentation is user-ready and project is prepared for release

### Phase 3: Polish & Release ✅
**Goal**: Final polish and PyPI release preparation

**Key Deliverables**:
- Code coverage measurement and reporting
- Final documentation review and updates
- License header and metadata polish
- Version 0.1.0 release to PyPI

**Success Criteria**: Project meets community standards for open-source Python libraries

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Build System**: Setuptools with PEP 621 configuration
2. **Documentation**: MkDocs with Material theme
3. **Testing**: pytest with coverage measurement
4. **Linting**: Ruff for fast, comprehensive linting
5. **Formatting**: Black for consistent code style
6. **Type Checking**: mypy for static type safety
7. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing and PyPI publishing
8. **Authentication**: Leverages PyGraphistry's existing auth infrastructure

## Future Roadmap

After Phase 3 completion, potential enhancements include:
- Async support for non-blocking calls
- Support for new LouieAI endpoints as they become available
- Enhanced response parsing (e.g., auto-launch Graphistry visualizations)
- Example notebooks and tutorials
- Integration tests with staging environment
- Streaming response support

## Using This Plan

Each phase file contains:
1. Critical meta-goals and execution protocol
2. Phase-specific context and success criteria
3. Quick reference commands
4. Detailed step-by-step instructions
5. Space for recording results and decisions

To work on a phase:
1. Open the corresponding phase file
2. Follow the Step Execution Protocol
3. Update ONLY the "Steps" section with results
4. Never modify the read-only sections

Remember: The plan is your only memory. Trust it completely.
