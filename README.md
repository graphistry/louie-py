**LouieAI** is an AI-driven investigative platform by [Graphistry](https://www.graphistry.com) that brings generative AI into data analysis. This repository contains the **Python client library** for LouieAI, allowing developers to send natural language prompts/queries to LouieAI and get results programmatically.

## Features
- **Easy Authentication**: Leverages PyGraphistry's authentication. Log in once with Graphistry, and LouieAI uses the same session.
- **Simple API**: Ask questions via the `LouieClient.ask(prompt)` method and receive answers or visualizations.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for HTTP errors, network issues, and authentication problems.
- **Integration**: Responses can include Graphistry visualizations, database queries, and more as generated by LouieAI.

*This package is in early development (Alpha stage). Core functionality is minimal but the scaffold for expansion is in place.*

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+ and an existing Graphistry account.

Install from PyPI:
```bash
uv pip install louieai
```

(Until published, you can install from source via pip or uv:)
```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/<owner>/louieai.git
```

## Quick Start

```python
import graphistry
from louieai import LouieClient

# Authenticate to Graphistry (replace with your credentials or API token)
graphistry.register(api=3, username="your_user", password="your_pass")

client = LouieClient()
result = client.ask("Summarize the latest alerts in Splunk and graph the entities.")
print(result)
```

This will send your prompt to the LouieAI service. The result might be a JSON containing an answer or instructions (for example, a link to a Graphistry visualization).

## Error Handling

The client provides detailed error information to help with debugging:

```python
from louieai import LouieClient
import graphistry

try:
    graphistry.register(api=3, username="your_user", password="your_pass")
    client = LouieClient()
    result = client.ask("Your prompt here")
    print(result)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Error messages include:
    # - HTTP errors (4xx/5xx): Status code and API error message
    # - Network errors: Connection failure details
    # - Authentication errors: Missing Graphistry token guidance
```

## Current Limitations

- **API Endpoint**: Currently uses `/api/ask` endpoint based on common REST patterns. This is subject to confirmation when official Louie.ai API documentation becomes available.
- **Response Format**: Returns raw JSON responses. Future versions may include enhanced parsing and result handling.
- **Synchronous Only**: Currently supports synchronous requests only. Async support planned for future releases.
